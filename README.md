# Ranking the Severity of Death by COVID Based On Oneâ€™s Health Conditions Using Clustering

Over the past years, the COVID virus has affected many people around the world. Since the spread of COVID happened so abruptly, many hospitals were limited to the amount of resources to support those who are in critical conditions due to COVID. We wanted to solve this issue by creating a machine learning algorithm that classifies the severity of a patient based on their current symptoms.

## Datasets
For our dataset, we used a combination of two help us classify the severity of a patient.
1. NST-EST2021-alldata.csv from the United States Census Bureau
2. Conditions_Contributing_to_COVID-19_Deaths_by_State
_and_Age_Provisional_2020-2022.csv from CDC

## Modeling
Since the problem is identified as an unsupervised learning and the dataset is comprised of categorical features, we execute four clustering techniques for categorical data.
